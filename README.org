* Vaguely

Vaguely is a tool for exploratory data visualization, based on Vega-Lite, a high-level grammar of interactive graphics. Vaguely is a partial translation of that grammar into a Scratch-like blocks interface, making it easier to experiment with different visualizations.

You can use it here: https://vagueness.herokuapp.com/ (warning: may take awhile to start up)
